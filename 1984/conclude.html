							<h1>1984 and the Fragility of Freedom</h1>
							<p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="conclusion.png" alt="" /></div>
								George Orwell’s 1984 presents a chilling vision of a world where freedom is obliterated by totalitarian control. In Oceania, the Party’s power is absolute, achieved through constant surveillance, historical revisionism, and psychological manipulation. Orwell warns us that in such a society, even thoughts can be crimes, and individuality becomes the greatest threat.
							</p><p>
Winston Smith, the novel’s protagonist, symbolizes humanity’s enduring desire for freedom. His fleeting acts of rebellion—writing in his diary, loving Julia—represent resistance against overwhelming oppression. Yet, his eventual submission underscores Orwell’s bleak message: in a world where truth is controlled, freedom cannot survive.
</p><p><
In the modern era, Orwell’s insights remain profoundly relevant. Surveillance technologies, propaganda, and social conformity pose threats to individual freedom. 1984 challenges us to remain vigilant and to value freedom, not as an abstract ideal but as a fragile right that must be actively defended.
</p><p>
As you navigate Winston’s choices, consider: How much freedom are you willing to sacrifice for safety? And at what cost does true freedom come?
