          <h1>Dead Poets Society and the Cost of Conformity</h1>
          <p></p>
          <div class="image main"><img src="conclusion.png" alt="" /></div>
          Peter Weir’s Dead Poets Society explores the tension between individuality and societal expectations through the lens of freedom to think. Mr. Keating’s unorthodox teaching methods challenge
          Welton Academy’s rigid traditions, inspiring his students to question authority and embrace their own voices. Yet, the cost of freedom is steep: Neil Perry’s tragic end and Mr. Keating’s
          dismissal highlights the dangers of defying entrenched systems. The pivotal scenes of the film—such as Neil’s performance in A Midsummer Night’s Dream and the students’ secret
          gatherings—demonstrate that true freedom requires courage and often comes with sacrifices. Actively choosing to think for oneself, as seen in the revival of the Dead Poets Society, is an act
          of rebellion against conformity. Through this story, Dead Poets Society urges the reader to seize the day and prioritize freedom of thought over societal approval.
